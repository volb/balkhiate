# balkhiate

The goal of this project is to build a general purpose poetry scraper and translator, where inputting a poet, poem, and specified languages will return a specified poem. There are attempts at this already but none focus on translations or are general purpose enough. Because of my interest in Persian poetry, that is the first priority for this project. The first iteration will use the Stands4 Poetry.net API because virtually no other GitHub project uses it and because Poetry.net seems to have much more Persian poetry than PoetryDB, the preferred choice by most other projects, which seems to be a great service for English poetry. The project's name is a reference to Rabia Balkhi, one of the great Persian poets and translators of the medieval era.
